Appendix I: Security Issue Severities

[content]
| Level of Severity | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| High | Issues that have security vulnerabilities with high risks. A high level risk issue is defined as when a successfully exploit occurs, it results in direct loss of funds or permanent freezing of funds. The high risk severity issues must be resolved. |
| Medium | Issues that have security vulnerabilities with medium risks. A medium level risk issue is only exploitable under conditions or with some prerequisites. All medium severity issues must be resolved unless there are clear explanations or standard operation procedures to avoid the potential rish to be exploited. |
| Low | Issues that have security vulnerabilities with low risks. A low level risk issue would not result in the failure of the system when a hacker realizes it. The client can decide if they want to revise the code for a low level risk issue. |
| Informational | Issues that pose no risk to the system but related with the best practices. The client can decide if they want to revise the code for an informational level issue. |
| Concerned | Issues that are not included in the auditing scope but we suggest the client to double check before the launch. |
