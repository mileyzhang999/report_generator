The report is solely for the Client and published with their consent. The scope of our audit is limited to a review of code, and only the code we note as being within the scope of our audit. It is important to note that the Solidity code itself presents unique and unquantifiable risks since the language itself continues to be developed and is subject to unknown risks and flaws. Our sole goal is to help reduce the risk of security attacks that is inherent in utilizing new and consistently changing technologies. Thus, Canary Technologies Inc in no way claims any guarantee of security or functionality of the code we agree to analyze.

In addition, our reports do not provide any indication of the audited technologies’ proprietors, business and/or legal compliance. Also, our reports do not provide investment advice and should not be used to make decisions about investment or involvement with any particular project.  We reserve the right to distribute the reports through other means, including via Canary Technologies’ publications. We may make the reports available to parties other than the Client (i.e., “third parties”) or on our website in hopes that it can help the blockchain sector develop technical best practices.
